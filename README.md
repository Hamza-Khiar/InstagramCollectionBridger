# Instagram Collection Bridger (Import & Export)

this is a tool i made primarly for my own usecase, i'll explain my situation on the next block:

> Basically i had an old account that i want to delete, but it had tons (+2000 posts in total) of saved posts & collections that i couldn't just send posts one by one & from my old account into the new account, i had to figure out a way to do so.
> I tried to find a solution but instagram doesn't have an api for non-business usage (for personal usage); then i thought, "hey it's just bunch of apis & http network requests at the end"; i decided to make my own tool, reverse engineering the instagram api to do what i can.



{ make good documentation of the tool }
